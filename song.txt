Living easy, living free
Season ticket on a one way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everythin' in my stride
Don't need reason
Don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I’d rather do
Goin' down
Party time
My friends are gonna be there too, yeah

I’m on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I’m on the highway to hell

No stop signs
Speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel
Gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey Satan
Payin' my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey mama
Look at me
I’m on the way to the promised land
Woo!

I’m on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I’m on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

Don't stop me
Heh, heh!

I’m on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I’m on the highway to hell
(Highway to hell) I’m on the highway to hell
(Highway to hell) highway to hell
(Highway to hell) highway to hell
(Highway to hell)

And I’m going down
All the way
I’m on the highway to hell
