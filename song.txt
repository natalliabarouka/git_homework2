Living easy, living free
Season ticket on a one way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everythin' in my stride
Don't need reason
Don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I’d rather do
Goin' down
Party time
My friends are gonna be there too, yeah

I’m on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I’m on the highway to hell
